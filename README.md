# Prehistoric---Java
This is the Prehistoric Engine's Java version, which is developed differently then the C++ version.

The engine has several features, including:
  -A working Entity-Component-System, with several components already implemented
  -An under-development Rendering Engine which has lots of features, a PBR rendering pipeline, a terrain rendering pipeline (PBR is under development)
      a GUI rendering system which is not finished, an HDR enviromental map converter system, which creates irradiance and prefiltered maps
      for the PBR pipeline, a realistic atmosphere with light scatter simulations, and a ray tracing pipeline with compute shaders is to be added soon
  -The basics of a Physics Engine is layed down, it will be implemented soon
  -The engine has a very high level of flexibility, the shaders and configuration files are not included in the .jar file, can be modified after compilation
  -A .scene file format is very close to be added from the C++ version
  
This engine is not ready, it may not be used in any kind of project!
